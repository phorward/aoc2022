# Wishlist

- Syntax
  - `for...in` is definitely missing!
  - Rename `loop` back into `while` as it is more awk/c/python/rust-like.
  - Constant list or dict `x : (1, 2, 3)` cannot be defined (becomes a parselet)
  - Instead of `l[1][2]`, maybe also `l[1, 2]` or even `l[1 2]`? This would continue the sequence syntax for indexing
  - Alternative syntax for functions like `fn test(a, b, c=2) {}` should be considered
    - The syntax is more straitforward
    - Functions are never consuming
- Semantics
  - It is difficult to distinguish between locals and globals. There should be some kind of `global` keyword like in Python; When a globally known variable is used only, this should be no problem. When assigned, it becomes local. When explcit global assignment is wanted, the variable must be imported with `global`.
- Sequences
  - `+` and `*` operators should always return a list, as expected!
  - `ast()` can optionally "flatten" and "clean-up" lists with only one entry
  - `$*` could be a list of all sequence items
- `list`
  - I want to define a list named `list`! Currently it overrides the list constructor. In Python, this problem exists as well, and makes Python ugly.
  - Should have their own syntax `l = []`
  - When I have a list `l = ()` and I do `l[0] = 1`, it should be like a push (currently `list_set_item() assignment index 0 beyond list sized 0`)
    - How can I construct a list of size X with a default value set?
  - Quick way to obtain last and first item
  - Slices would be useful in many ways
    - `sum((elfs[0],elfs[1],elfs[2]))` => `sum(elfs[..2])`
  - `range()` or other way to define a counted list
    - `x == pix - 1 || x == pix || x == pix + 1`
      - could be `x in range(pix - 1, pix + 1)`
      - or even `x in (pix - 1..pix + 1)`
  - `copy()`
  - `sort()`
  - `min()`
  - `max()`
  - `sum()`
- `dict`
  - I want to define a dict named `dict`! Currently it overrides the dict constructor. In Python, this problem exists as well, and makes Python ugly.
  - `d = ()` should be a dict creation!
  - `str`
  - `count()`
  - `contains()` or `"substr" in s`
- `int`/`float`
  - Missing `abs()` function
  - Missing `lcm()` function
